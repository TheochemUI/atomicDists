* About
This repository contains code for constructing distances between atomic
configurations [fn:whyatomic]. The intended use-case is for generating
covariance matrices, with an associated library. Typically this is used in
conjunction with ~readCon~, but primary downstream users would use the bindings.
** Features
- Euclidean distances
- Generic ~SimpleMatrix~
** Development
*** Developing locally
A ~pre-commit~ job is setup on CI to enforce consistent styles, so it is best to
set it up locally as well (using [[https://pypa.github.io/pipx][pipx]] for isolation):

#+begin_src sh
# Run before commiting
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
#+end_src

[fn:whyatomic] Some of the distances are generic, and can be suitable for any N-dimensional system
